            <h1> Justin's startup webpage part 1 </h1>
            <div> This is a start up to my webpage. The image to the left is my favorite game, League of Legends, which I play religiously. The image to the right is my most prominent hobby and serves as my greatest motivation in life. The background picture, Darth vador, is my favorite fictional villian. Star Wars is my all time favorite show. Both images are linked to their respective homepage.</div>
